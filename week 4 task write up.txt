A paired t-test showed that the cross-pollinated maize were significantly taller than the self-pollinated plants by an average of 2.6 inches (95% CI: 0.004-5.23).

Why no F-tests, df or P values? Well in theory this gives us the same qualititative information as we know that our 95% CI range is >0 so we can say that the difference in height is significant at P<0.05. And we are providing direct biological information about the estimated height difference.

BUT most people will expect you to report F values, df, P values etc. so you should probably include them as well.

A pairwise linear model showed that the cross-pollinated maize were significantly taller than the self-pollinated plants (F1,14= 4.61, P = 0.05) by an average of 2.6 inches (95% CI: 0.004-5.23).

EFFECT SIZE: Finally although we know we have a significant height difference it is only by a very small margin (0.004 inches). In this way we can actually say we have 95% confidence that the height difference is at least 0.004 inches. If we wanted to we could estimate a range of confidence intervals e.g. we have 66% confidence that the height difference is at least 1.4 inches {confint(model, level=0.66)}.
